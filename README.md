# Hypersecure Shell

**Hypersecure Shell (HSS)** is an alternative to SSH, written entirely in Python, designed to run **without root privileges** for remote computer control. It uses **Open Safe Quantum encryption** ‚Äî a next-generation cryptographic method built to resist attacks from quantum computers.

---

## üöÄ Why I Created This

Initially, I didn‚Äôt have a computer‚Äîonly a mobile phone. I ran SSH on it and found that it was slow and frequently froze. I wanted to create my own version because it seemed interesting to build and would be a good learning opportunity.

During development, I discovered quantum-safe encryption methods‚Äîmathematical principles designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers‚Äîand integrated them into HSS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

This is the first release.

* Encryption in `protocol2.py` is focused on making **liboqs-python** work.
* Some minor security features and performance may not be fully optimized.
---

## üì¶ Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3+
* `pip`
* Command-line knowledge

**Recommended:** Run inside a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .hssvenv
source .hssvenv/bin/activate
```

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/9boom/Hypersecure-Shell.git

# 2. Enter directory
cd Hypersecure-Shell

# 3. Install dependencies
bash install.sh
```

Installation may take several minutes.

### Main Sections

| Section                | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **\[server]**          | HSS server configuration. Run this to host and accept connections to allow remote. |
| **\[remote]**          | Connect to a running HSS server to remote.                                        |
| **\[bklogger-here]**   | Back up logs to another server (run separately from main server).       |
| **\[bklogger-to]**     | Pull logs from main server to local machine.                            |
| **\[wormhole-config]** | Create a wormhole ticket (explained below).                             |
| **\[wormhole-remote]** | Unlock a wormhole on the target server using a ticket.                  |

---

## üñ• Usage

Run a section:

```bash
./hss.py <section_name>
```

Example:

```bash
./hss.py wormhole-config
```

---

## üîê Special Features

### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

Set `use_ZKP = 1` in `[server]` to require clients to **prove** they know the password **without sending it**‚Äîprotecting against eavesdropping.

### Wormhole Mode

Experimental security feature to hide the real HSS server:

* Opens a temporary **random port** (wormhole)
* Requires a valid **ticket** to unlock the real server
* Incorrect tickets result in an abort and block

---

### Wormhole Workflow

**On the server:**

1. Enable wormhole mode:

   ```ini
   use_wormhole = 1
   ```
2. Generate ticket:

   ```bash
   ./hss.py wormhole-config
   ```
3. Ticket is saved at `outputs/wormhole/spaceship.ticket`.
4. Share the ticket with the intended client.

**On the client:**

1. Set `wormhole_ticket` in `security.ini` to the ticket path.
2. Unlock wormhole:

   ```bash
   ./hss.py wormhole-remote
   ```
3. If successful:

   ```
   Passed, Go ahead!
   ```
4. Connect:

   ```bash
   ./hss.py remote
   ```
